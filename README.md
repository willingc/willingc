I'm also a leader in open science and open-source governance. I'm driven to make open science accessible through open tools and learning materials.

- 2017 ACM Software System Award for Project Jupyter's lasting influence
- 2019 Frank Willison Award for technical and community contributions to Python

I enjoy speaking about Python, Jupyter notebooks, scaling reproducible research, learning, open source governance, cognitive science, and the intersection of technology and society.
